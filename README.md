## Assignment 1  
Upload the URL to the PFDA assignment repository.  
https://github.com/dvdgeroconnell/PFDA-assignments.git

## Assignment 2  
Create a jupyter notebook called *assignment2-weather.ipynb* with a plot of the "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" field over time.  

## Assignment 3  
Create a notebook called *assignment03-pie.ipynb* with a pie chart of people's email domains in the csv file at the url https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download. This csv file has 1000 people. The data was downloaded to the file people-1000.csv.  

## Assignment 4  
There was no assignment 4.  

## Assignment 5  
Create a Python program (or notebook) called *assignment_5_risk* (*.py* or *.ipynb*). Calculate the outcome of either:
- A user-provided number of individual battle rounds in the game Risk; and plot the total attackers and total defenders lost in a pie chart.  
- Calculate a random number of attackers and defenders, and run until one or the other is depleted to zero. The attack and defence losses after each round are plotted in a line graph.  
  
The program is run by executing the command `python assignment_5_risk.py` from the command line.  

## Assignment 6
Create a Python program (or notebook) called *assignment_6_Weather* (*.py* or *.ipynb*) to retrieve weather data from https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv and to plot:  
  a) For 60%  
     - The temperature  
     - The mean temperature each day  
     - The mean temperature for each month  
  b) For an additional 40%  
     - The Windspeed (data missing from this column)  
     - The rolling windspeed over 24 hours  
     - The max windspeed for each day  
     - The monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds  
   
The program is run by executing the command `python .\assignment_6_Weather.py` from the command line.  
One figure with 4 individual plots is drawn.
